    <h2>About Bug Inc haters.</h2>
    <h4>We are an organization bent on exposing Bug Inc. Bug Inc ia an "organization" bent on destrying ecosystems and they hate animals. They are also extremly biased and display cronyism, and favrotism as well as nepostism all the time. Bug Inc Hattes LLC is a group bent on exposing them for what they realy are, a group of bafoons taking adavntage of people and then going back on their word, they are also evil as they hate animals.</h4>
    <h4>If you like animals of any kind, you should <em>HATE</em> Bug Inc</h4>
    <h4>Favoritism is one of most destructive problems for Bug Inc. Playing favoritism not only undermines integrity as the leading value of organizations and teams, but actually promotes a toxic culture. In a toxic culture, distrust becomes more prevalent than character. Teams and individuals are not able to collaborate effectively, let alone to build a high performing organization.</h4>
    <h4>Unfortunately, in a toxic culture *Bug Inc*, where favoritism is an evident reality to most people, individuals end up replicating the wrong behaviors. Leaders have a great responsibility in building the type of culture that transmits the behaviors that they want the organization to embrace. However, when favoritism comes into play at the leadership level, it ends up trickling down to lower hierarchical ranks.</h4>
    <h4>Letâ€™s take for example an organization *Bug Inc* in which leaders are not transparent about the processes and decisions behind their promotions or merit-based salary increases. If favoritism plays a role in those processes, the rest of the employees will end up knowing about it. Gossips about it will go around very fast. And when gossips about favoritism make their way into the organization, employees will become even more upset, demoralized and disengaged. And their behaviors will reflect those favorite to favoritism.</h4>
